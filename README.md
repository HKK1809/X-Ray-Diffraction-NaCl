This lab report focuses on X-Ray diffraction of behavior of various crystals. Copper is used as an x-ray source for the experiment. 
Firstly, Sodium Chloride (NaCl) crystals of miller indices (100, 110, 111) were exposed to x-rays. From which the backscatter of the NaCl Crystals was measured using a goniometer. 
Using this back scatter, the lattice constant 5.7601+/- 0.0051 (ùê¥Ãá) of NaCl crystals was calculated. 
Secondly, Lithium Fluoride (LiF) sample was exposed to the X-rays and the backscatter was used to develop a photographic film. 
The pattern developed on the photographic film was used to analyze the wavelength spectrum of the x-rays. Finally, an unknown crystal sample was used and was exposed to x-rays for 6 hours. 
The setup was used to develop a photographic film. 
The film was analyzed to calculate the lattice constant of the sample used and thus recognize the sample. It was found that the sample used was Iron (Fe) with the lattice constant 2.866 ùê¥Ãá.

The files in the the repository include MATLAB code for data analysis and Excel files containing datad points and data analysis.
